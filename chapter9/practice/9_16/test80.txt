One hot summer day a fox was walking through an orchard. He stopped before a bu
nch of grapes. They were ripe and juicy."I'm just feeling thirsty," he thought. So he backed up a few paces, got a running start, jumped up, but could not reach the grapes.He walked back. One, two, three, he jumped up again, but still, he missed the grapes.The fox tried again and again, but never succeeded. At last he decided to give it up.He walked away with his nose in the air, and saidâ€œI am sure they are sour.â€

A crow felt very thirsty. He looked for water everywhere. Finally, he found a p
itcher.But there was not a lot of water in the pitcher. His beak could not reach it. He tried again and again, but still could not touch the water.When he was about to give up, an idea came to him. He took a pebble and dropped it into the pitcher. Then he took another and dropped it in.Gradually, the water rose, and the crow was able to drink the water.

A crow felt very thirsty. He looked for water everywhere. Finally, he found a p



itcher.But there was not a lot of water in the pitcher. His beak could not reac

h it. He tried again and again, but still could not touch the water.When he was
 about to give up, an idea came to him. He took a pebble and dropped it into the pitcher. Then he took another and dropped it in.Gradually, the water rose, and the crow was able to drink the water.

A crow felt very thirsty. He looked for water everywhere. Finally, he found a p















itcher.But there was not a lot of water in the pitcher. His beak could not reac







h it. He tried again and again, but still could not touch the water.When he was



 about to give up, an idea came to him. He took a pebble and dropped it into th

e pitcher. Then he took another and dropped it in.Gradually, the water rose, an
d the crow was able to drink the water.
